Tunnels of Light is a game where the player experiences tragic real-life events that have mentally scarred them but learn to overcome their problems and find their own peace and happiness. Players will have life points that go down when they make certain decisions, and meet another person that might help the player if you make the right choice. Tunnels of Light conveys the idea that no matter hard life is there is always light at the end of the tunnel.
